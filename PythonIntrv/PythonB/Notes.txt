Q. Why canâ€™t a list be used as a dictionary key?
-> A list cannot be used as a dictionary key in Python because:

Dictionary keys must be immutable and hashable
â€¢	A dictionary key must have a fixed hash value during its lifetime.
â€¢	Lists are mutable â€” you can change their contents after creation.
â€¢	This mutability means their hash value would change if their contents change, breaking the dictionaryâ€™s internal structure.
